Description
-----------
MO6 is a two-column light weight theme, fixed width, fixed columns,
re-colorable. The theme is targeted for blog use. It's goal is to optimize for
search engines, minimizing html, css and images, making pages as fast as
possible while maintaining a effective design.

Features
--------
The theme uses Drupal 6 theme settings to configure certain theme options 
(no CSS editing required).

 * Tableless
 * 7 regions
 * Fixed width: configurable via theme settings
 * Re-colorable
 * 2 columns: main content centered, right sidebar asymmetrically placed
   slightly covering main content column
 * Support for: Site name, Site slogan, User pictures in posts, User pictures
   in comments, Shortcut icon, Primary links
 * Valid XHTML
 * Clean and light weight HTML and CSS
 * Light weight on images: 3 images: gradient background (554 bytes), header
   photo (11.8 KB), bullet (402 bytes)
 * Header (and footer) image are configurable
 * Several html elements can be re-colored via theme settings / color wheel
 * Option for a more compact display of comment entry form for anonymous users
 * Transparency in blocks
 * Nicely rounded blocks and other elements (with graceful fall-back for
   browsers not supporting CSS3)
 * Comes with cool sample "Drop" header (770 x 150px) :)

---------------------
Tested and fully functional on:

 * Internet Explorer 6.0 (and up, some IE versions missing advanced CSS features
   like rounded corners)

 * Chrome 5.0 (and up)
 * Safari 5.0 (and up)

Development
-----------
A first release for general use is available for Drupal 6. Have a look at the
live demo site http://www.mo6.nl/ to see what the theme looks like.
Development for Drupal 7 will start soon.

Please contribute your ideas in the issue queue. The MO6 theme gets better 
because of community input. :-)
